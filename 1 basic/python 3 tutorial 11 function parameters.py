def simple_addition(num1,num2):
	answer = num1 + num2
	print('num1 is', num1)
	print('answer is', answer)

##print num1 is 3 answer is 8
simple_addition(3,5)

##can be use like this but rarely use
simple_addition(num1 = 5,num2 = 3)

##will have errors since there is only 1 argument
simple_addition(5)
